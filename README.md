# C-small-projects

This repository is used mainly to store and organize class excercises and projects, done on C++.

Other contributors are mainly classmates that I work with on class assignments and projects.


## First Semester

[First semester](C-small-projects/1st Semester Activities/Activity 1/main.cpp) contains small practices made to learn fundamentals such as math operators and boolean operators, input and output through console, etc.
